## complex AND-NOT of match and notmatch words
##
## to activate this regex, remove the ; (only the ;) in front of the lines
## and change/add/remove the words/regexes to your needs
##
## the complex regex will match if:
##   the count of match- words/regexes is reached AND
##   the count of notmatch- words/regexes is NOT reached
##
## if the same match (word) is found multiple times consecutively in any of both matching groups,
## (match and notmatch) only the last match is counted
## word1 word1 word1 - counts 1 (word1 multiple times consecutively)
## word1 word2 word1 - counts 3 (word1 multiple times but not consecutively)
## word2 word1 word1 - counts 2 (word1 multiple times consecutively)
## 
## It is possible to define more than one of these regexes in one file.
##
## Notice, that if you define single words or regexes between two of these complex regexes,
## the complex regexes will be processed first (before any single words or regexes outside).
## To prevent confusing output of the assp-analyzing tools write all complex regexes at
## the start of your files - followed by the other definitions
##
## It is possible to define such complex regex in an include file.

# the next line prevents assp from optimizing this complex regex

# write the needed ~ in front of the next line
